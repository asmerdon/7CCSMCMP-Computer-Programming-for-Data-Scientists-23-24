# Complexity analysis X vs Y:
# Assuming the tree is balanced, a BST has a logarithmic time complexity for searching for a value (O(log N)).
# This can be seen on the graph plotting X and Y, as the run time doesn't increase much despite the size of the BST increasing by 20x by the end.
# If the tree is not balanced however, the search time would be linear (O(N)).
# This is because it would have to search through each node to find the value, instead of being able to halve the search space at each node.
# Close figure to get figure 2.

# Calculate Y2 (linear prediction based off average times at 5 and 10)
t1 = Y[X.index(5)]  # average search time for n=5
t2 = Y[X.index(10)]  # average search time for n=10
c = (t2 - t1) / (10 - 5) # solving equations t = c âˆ— n + b, difference in average search time / difference in tree size
b = t1 - 5 * c # intercept
Y2 = [c * n + b for n in X] # estimates search times for other tree sizes in X (t)

# I could not figure out how to calculate and plot Y3. A logarithmic relationship to the size of the tree (Y3) would plot a curve lower than the linear relationship (which would be a 45 degree line, as shown in Y2).

# Complexity analysis X vs Y, Y2, Y3:
# There could be a few reasons that Y does not follow the logarithmic Y3. Firstly, during the tests there may not be enough trees with 42 being created to give an accurate sample.
# This may impact how the graph is plotted, and how the logarithmic search times are calculated, with Y3 following a different curve to Y.
# When I run my code on this machine, there seems to be an issue where the first or second trees (5 or 10) end up taking longer to search than subsequent ones.
# To get closer to the line in Y3, we may want to increase the amount of testing we do to get better results.
# Changing the values of n may also give better predictions, as the time difference between n=5 and n=10 is so minimal when measuring the time that it can cause issues with the function (I get a much better looking plot for Y2 when I change n=10 to n=25).

# Complexity analysis X vs Y, Y2, Y3 and Y4:
# A linked list is has a linear time complexity for searching, unlike a BST, which has a logarithmic time complexity.
# The link list (Y4) follows the line of Y2, whilst the BST follows a logarithmic curve.
# This is because a linked list has to search node by node to find the value 42, whereas the BST can prune half of the search space at each node (if balanced).
# This makes it a much more efficient data structure for storing integers.
